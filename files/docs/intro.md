This package requires Node `~0.10.0`

If you haven't used [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](https://nodejs.org/community/) guide, as it explains how to install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) and use a [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file. 
Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this package with this command:

```shell
npm install polyfiller --save-dev
```

Once the package has been installed, it may be used inside your files with this line of JavaScript:

```js
var Polyfiller = require('polyfiller');
```
